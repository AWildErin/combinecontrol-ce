# CombineControl Community Edition

This is a fork of the Official [CombineControl](https://github.com/disseminate/combinecontrol) repository by Disseminate. This repository plans to add new updates, fixes and more to CombineControl as the main gamemode is not being updated anymore. If you wish to contribute to any of the ideas we plan to add, feel free to fork and add a pull request and we'll review it. As it's open source anybody can contribute!

## Setup

To download the gamemode, you have two choices, download the `develop`, which is possibly unstable but is the newest, or download it from the releases tab. The setup is largely the same, just keep in mind that the `develop` branch will possibly have issues.

Requires [gmsv_mysqloo](https://github.com/FredyH/MySQLOO). More detailed info is available in the [manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/127VaxlOMR720Hcu0Kue2kid6sqf6YfaxlnjHUbwvgRc/edit?usp=sharing).

Set up the MySQL connection info in `gamemode/config/sv_config.lua`.

If you're not on one of the maps in `gamemode/maps/*.lua` you will need to make that file.
