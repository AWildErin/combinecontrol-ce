# CombineControl

This is the official repo for the Garry's Mod roleplay gamemode CombineControl. It is no longer being developed by me but pull requests will be reviewed.

## Setup

Requires [gmsv_mysqloo](https://github.com/FredyH/MySQLOO). More detailed info is available in the [manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/127VaxlOMR720Hcu0Kue2kid6sqf6YfaxlnjHUbwvgRc/edit?usp=sharing).

Set up the MySQL connection info in `gamemode/config/sv_config.lua`.

If you're not on one of the maps in `gamemode/maps/*.lua` you will need to make that file.
