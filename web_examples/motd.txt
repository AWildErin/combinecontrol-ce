Lots of stuff going on lately! We've mostly got the CCA stabilized with four squads - JURY, VICE and XRAY as NA, UNION as EU.

New maps are coming along well - there is now mapdata for City 18, City 45 and City 45 2013. Make map suggestions on the forums!

As always, don't forget to read F1 - it's frequently updated.
